## Protein Sequence Analysis

**Basic Concept:** RNA (or DNA that can be transcribed into RNA) will be input by the user. This program will then analyze the protein sequence derived from the RNA and can predict secondary structures or motifs.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this program is to make the analysis of RNA, DNA, and protein structures faster and more accurate, as current methods—especially those used in high school and middle school classes—are time-consuming, energy-intensive, and prone to human error.
