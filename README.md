## Protein Sequence Analysis

**Basic Concept:** RNA (or DNA that can be transcribed into RNA) will be input by the user. This program will then analyze the protein sequence derived from the RNA and can predict secondary structures or motifs.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this program is to make analyzing RNA, DNA, and/or protein structures faster and more accurate, as current methods in classes require a lot of time/energy and are often subjected to human error.
